## Lecture 11 - Handling Messages with Bloc

In this part we implement a Notifications Bloc which handles the messages coming into the platform.





### Setting up your environment before the lecture

Each lecture is stored under a separate tag. In your computer do the following

    git clone <Repository Name>
    git pull
    git tag -l

This will list you all the tags in the repository such as

    Lecture4
    Lecture5
    Lecture6
    ...

In order to pull a particular tag to your computer

    git checkout tags/Lecture5_start -b Lecture5_study
